## Bon Me Rice Bowls
This applcation is a replica of the famous Bon Me restaurant. However, this focuses on their delicious rice bowls. 
To place an order, the customer's first name, last name, and whatever they want to name their meal are required. 
Include a very brief summary of your project here. The name can be anything from Treasure Island to bon appetit. 

Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text.

Here is a sample formula for summarizing your activities, talk about:
- the domain area the project pertains to
- the main challenges or problems the application addresses
- the key innovations that make it possible to address the problem
- the main results of the implementation, does it really address the problem?
- any additional implications of the resulting application, or possibly areas for future work that have been discovered as part of the design and implementation activities

(Note that when I use the above formula, I aim to have only one sentence per thought in order to remain concise.)
