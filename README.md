## Bon Me Rice Bowls
This applcation is a replica of the famous Bon Me restaurant. However, this focuses on their delicious rice bowls. 
To place an order, the customer's first name, last name, and whatever they want to name their meal are required. 
Include a very brief summary of your project here. The name can be anything from Treasure Island to bon appetit. 
When the customer places their order, that order is them put under the "view orders" page with the other customer 
orders. This data is organized in a table where customers can modify or delete their orders. I made it so that the 
once the customer logs onto the application, they feel even more hungry than they already do, by putting a picture 
that is clear and rich with color of some of the available rice bowl options.
